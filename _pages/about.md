<!-- 
Nguyen's Information
====== -->
I am a Computer Science engineer graduated at International University - VNU Ho Chi Minh City. During my academic career, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the development of web and mobile applications, the management of server systems, and the implementation of machine learning and deep learning models through practical project-based experiences and academic courses. 

Moreover, I also have some experience in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop innovative solutions that leverage the synergy between these two cutting-edge fields.

Currently, in my role as a research member of [AIoT Lab VN](https://aiotlab.vn/), I have actively engaged in numerous academic competitions and have successfully published scientific articles in both national and international conferences and publications.

I am in search of opportunities to work in a challenging environment that offers the potential for personal development.
