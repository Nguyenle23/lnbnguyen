| Bachelor Project: Real-time Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting System with Fog Computing Technology | This is a thesis project under the supervision of Dr. Le Duy Tan.It aims to investigate the development of an air quality monitoring system that utilizes low-cost real-time sensors, while incorporating fog computing technologies. The integration of open-source projects, such as ThingsBoard and OpenStreetMap, has been effectively accomplished to facilitate the real-time visualization of data on web and mobile platforms. Using Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast the air quality in the next hour with 5-minute intervals. |
